                    <p> My name is Ryan Hatfield. My wife Emilyn and I have been married for 11 years. We have two children, one boy and one girl. My son is the oldest, 10, and his name is Porter. 
                        My daughter is 8 and her name is Adilyn. We love to travel the world and experience new cultures and adventures. I love anything outdoors, but mainly camping, hunting, fishing and hiking. 
                        I was born and raised in Garland, Texas. I lived there until 2009 when joined the U.S. Navy. 
                     </p>
                    <p> My job in the Navy was an Avionics Electronic Technician. I served five years in the Navy. in 2014 I moved back to Texas and got a job in the Oil and Gas Industry around the
                        San Antonio Area. In 2016 I got a new job with another Oil company, still live in the San Antonio area, but travel frequently to North Dakota.
                        Currently I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp course at The University of Texas at San Antonio. This course is teaching me to become a Full Stack Web Developer.
                        I feel this skill will be very useful in the future and I am excited for the challenges that await.
                    </p>
